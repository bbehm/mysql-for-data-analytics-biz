# MySQL for Data Analytics

Repo structure:

- __Part 1: Sandbox__ - where I play around with commands
- __Part 2: Assignments__ - assignment solutions for the course
- *theory.md* - where I store some useful theory and resources

- To access and work with the MySQL databases I use [SequelPro](https://www.sequelpro.com/). [Here](https://gist.github.com/joeyklee/5ada6a254804c33dbebbca4161277836) you can find a good tutorial on how to set up MySQL with SequelPro using brew. Also, to avoid bugs download [this](https://sequelpro.com/test-builds) version of SequelPro.
- Info on SQL statements can be found from the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-statements.html).
